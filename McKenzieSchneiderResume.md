## Experience

**BidPro** | UX Designer \
July-August 2019 // Chicago, IL

I partnered with a home service startup to create
an end-to-end mobile MVP. I conducted UX research,
ideation, usability studies, and iterations to prepare the
product for development handoff. The outcome was a pivot
for BidPro as we identified and had research to support a
more promising market differentiator.

**Explore Interactive** | UX Designer \
June-July 2019 // Chicago, IL

I worked on a project to improve the usability and
engagement of an augmented reality STEM education app.
The process consisted of user research, concepting,
prototyping, user interviewing, and testing. The resultant
prototype was an engaging onboarding experience that
promoted improved app functionality.

**Peace Corps** | Youth Development \
September 2017-February 2019 // Morocco

I performed community outreach and created curricula
while teaching English and facilitating girl empowerment
programs. A major highlight was initiating and serving on
the first Peace Corps Morocco diversity committee where I
advocated and educated others on the value of diversity
and allyship.

**Apex Learning** | Administrative Assistant \
May-September 2017 // Seattle, WA

I provided customer service, responding to customer
inquiries, performing data entry, and processing orders in
Salesforce for this online educational entity serving
secondary school-aged students.
